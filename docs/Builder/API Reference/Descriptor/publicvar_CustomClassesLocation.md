## Public variable information
```lua
Descriptor.CustomClassesLocation :: Instance?
```

This is a optional field for finding custom classes, if this is set it will find custom classes from this location instead rather than finding it under a folder called ``CustomClasses`` under the root ModuleScript.

See [this page](../../CustomClasses.md) for more information.
