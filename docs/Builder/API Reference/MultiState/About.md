``MultiState`` is a object where you can store values attached to a key/name, similar to dictionaries.

You cannot directly use a ``MultiState`` object inside a [``Description``](../Types/type_Description.md), unlike [``State``](../State/About.md) objects, instead you must use [``MultiStateResolvable``](../MultiStateResolvable/About.md).
