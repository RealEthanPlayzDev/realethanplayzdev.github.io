!!! danger "Note"
    * DeviceInfo **only** works on the **client**. Attempting to use this on the server will result a error upon loading the library.
    * As of October 4 2021, detection is no longer guranteed to be 100% correct as there is ways the detection can lead to false positives.

??? bug "A note to users upgrading from V1 to V2"
    The V2 update changes a lot of method names and how they work, it is suggested to re-read the source-code, the API reference, and update your code to match the new update.

DeviceInfo is a module designed to try and detect the player's platform, device type, etc. Inspired by World Builder's device detection, this module uses hacky ways to try to detect the device type, platform, etc __**however it should be noted that detection cannot be guranteed 100% correct**__
